Introduction
************

This manual documents how to use the PINENTRY and its protocol.

   The PINENTRY is a small GUI application used to enter PINs or
passphrases. It is usually invoked by GPG-AGENT (*note Invoking the
gpg-agent: (gnupg)Invoking GPG-AGENT, for details).

   PINENTRY comes in 3 flavors to fit the look and feel of the used GUI
toolkit:  A GTK+ based one named `pinentry-gtk', a QT based one named
`pinentry-qt' and a non-graphical one based on curses and named
`pinentry-curses'.  Not all of them might be available on your
installation.  If curses is supported on your system, the GUI based
flavors fall back to curses when the `DISPLAY' variable is not set.

1 How to use the PINENTRY
*************************

You may run PINENTRY directly from the command line and pass the
commands according to the Assuan protocol via stdin/stdout.

   Here is a list of options supported by all 3 flavors of pinentry

`--version'
     Print the program version and licensing information.

`--help'
     Print a usage message summarizing the most useful command line
     options.

`--debug'
`-d'
     Turn on some debugging.  Mostly useful for the maintainers.  Note
     that this may reveal sensitive information like the entered
     passphrase.

`--no-global-grab'
`-g'
     Grab the keyboard only when the window is focused.  Use this
     option if you are debugging software using the PINENTRY; otherwise
     you may not be able to to access your X session anymore (unless
     you have other means to connect to the machine to kill the
     PINENTRY).

`--parent-wid N'
     Use window ID N as the parent window for positioning the window.
     Note, that this is not fully supported by all flavors of PINENTRY.

`--display STRING'
`--ttyname STRING'
`--ttytype STRING'
`--lc-ctype STRING'
`--lc-messages STRING'
     These options are used to pass localization information to
     PINENTRY.  They are required because PINENTRY is usually called by
     some background process which does not have any information on the
     locale and terminal to use.  Assuan protocol options are an
     alternative way to pass these information.

2 pinentry's Assuan Protocol
****************************

The PIN-Entry should never service more than one connection at once.
It is reasonable to exec the PIN-Entry prior to a request.

   The PIN-Entry does not need to stay in memory because the GPG-AGENT
has the ability to cache passphrases.  The usual way to run the
PIN-Entry is by setting up a pipe (and not a socket) and then fork/exec
the PIN-Entry.  The communication is then done by means of the protocol
described here until the client is satisfied with the result.

   Although it is called a PIN-Entry, it does allow to enter reasonably
long strings (at least 2048 characters are supported by every
pinentry).  The client using the PIN-Entry has to check for correctness.

   Note that all strings are expected to be encoded as UTF-8; PINENTRY
takes care of converting it to the locally used codeset.  To include
linefeeds or other special characters, you may percent-escape them
(i.e. a line feed is encoded as `%0A', the percent sign itself is
encoded as `%25').

   Here is the list of supported commands:

`Set the descriptive text to be displayed'
            C: SETDESC Enter PIN for Richard Nixon <nobody@trickydicky.gov>
            S: OK

`Set the prompt to be shown'
     When asking for a PIN, set the text just before the widget for
     passphrase entry.
            C: SETPROMPT PIN:
            S: OK

     You should use an underscore in the text only if you known that a
     modern version of pinentry is used.  Modern versions underline the
     next character after the underscore and use the first such
     underlined character as a keyboard accelerator.  Use a double
     underscore to escape an underscore.

`Set the window title'
     This command may be used to change the default window title.  When
     using this feature you should take care that the window is still
     identifiable as the pinentry.
            C: SETTITLE Tape Recorder Room
            S: OK

`Set the button texts'
     There are three texts which should be used to override the English
     defaults:

     To set the text for the button signaling confirmation (in UTF-8).
     See SETPROMPT on how to use an keyboard accelerator.
            C: SETOK Yes
            S: OK

     To set the text for the button signaling cancellation or
     disagreement (in UTF-8).  See SETPROMPT on how to use an keyboard
     accelerator.
            C: SETCANCEL No
            S: OK

     In case tree buttons are required, use the follwing command to set
     the text (UTF-8) for the non-affirmative response button.  The
     affirmative button text is still set using SETOK and the CANCEL
     button text with SETCANCEL.  See SETPROMPT on how to use an
     keyboard accelerator.
            C: SETNOTOK Do not do this
            S: OK

`Set the Error text'
     This is used by the client to display an error message.  In
     contrast to the other commands this error message is automatically
     reset with a GETPIN or CONFIRM, and is only displayed when asking
     for a PIN.
            C: SETERROR Invalid PIN entered - please try again
            S: OK

`Enable a passphrase quality indicator'
     Adds a quality indicator to the GETPIN window.  This indicator is
     updated as the passphrase is typed.  The clients needs to
     implement an inquiry named "QUALITY" which gets passed the current
     passpharse (percent-plus escaped) and should send back a string
     with a single numerical vauelue between -100 and 100.  Negative
     values will be displayed in red.
            C: SETQUALITYBAR
            S: OK

     If a custom label for the quality bar is required, just add that
     label as an argument as percent escaped string.  You will need
     this feature to translate the label because pinentry has no
     internal gettext except for stock strings from the toolkit library.

     If you want to show a tooltip for the quality bar, you may use
            C: SETQUALITYBAR_TT string
            S: OK

     With STRING being a percent escaped string shown as the tooltip.

`Ask for a PIN'
     The meat of this tool is to ask for a passphrase of PIN, it is
     done with this command:
            C: GETPIN
            S: D no more tapes
            S: OK
     Note that the passphrase is transmitted in clear using standard
     data responses.  Expect it to be in UTF-8.

`Ask for confirmation'
     To ask for a confirmation (yes or no), you can use this command:
            C: CONFIRM
            S: OK
     The client should use SETDESC to set an appropriate text before
     issuing this command, and may use SETPROMPT to set the button
     texts.  The value returned is either OK for YES or the error code
     `ASSUAN_Not_Confirmed'.

`Show a message'
     To show a message, you can use this command:
            C: MESSAGE
            S: OK
     alternativly you may add an option to confirm:
            C: CONFIRM --one-button
            S: OK
     The client should use SETDESC to set an appropriate text before
     issuing this command, and may use SETOK to set the text for the
     dismiss button.  The value returned is OK or an error message.

`Set the output device'
     When using X, the PINENTRY program must be invoked with an
     appropriate `DISPLAY' environment variable or the `--display'
     option.

     When using a text terminal:
            C: OPTION ttyname=/dev/tty3
            S: OK
            C: OPTION ttytype=vt100
            S: OK
            C: OPTION lc-ctype=de_DE.UTF-8
            S: OK
     The client should use the `ttyname' option to set the output TTY
     file name, the `ttytype' option to the `TERM' variable appropriate
     for this tty and `lc-ctype' to the locale which defines the
     character set to use for this terminal.

`Set the default strings'
     To avoid having transaltions in Pinentry proper, the caller may set
     certain translated strings which are used by Pinentry as default
     strings.

            C: OPTION default-ok=_Korrekt
            S: OK
            C: OPTION default-cancel=Abbruch
            S: OK
            C: OPTION default-prompt=PIN eingeben:
            S: OK
     The strings are subject to accelerator marking, see SETPROMPT for
     details.

Appendix A GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
*************************************

                         Version 2, June 1991

     Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
     59 Temple Place - Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307, USA

     Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
     of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

A.0.1 Preamble
--------------

The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom
to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public License is
intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
the GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
your programs, too.

   When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in
new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

   To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

   For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
rights.

   We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software,
and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
distribute and/or modify the software.

   Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
authors' reputations.

   Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

   The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

    TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
  1. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a
     notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
     under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program",
     below, refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on
     the Program" means either the Program or any derivative work under
     copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Program or a
     portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or
     translated into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is
     included without limitation in the term "modification".)  Each
     licensee is addressed as "you".

     Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are
     not covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act
     of running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the
     Program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on
     the Program (independent of having been made by running the
     Program).  Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.

  2. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
     source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
     conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
     copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
     notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
     warranty; and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of
     this License along with the Program.

     You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
     and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange
     for a fee.

  3. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
     of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
     distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
     above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

       a. You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

       b. You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that
          in whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program
          or any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge
          to all third parties under the terms of this License.

       c. If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
          when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
          interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display
          an announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and
          a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you
          provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the
          program under these conditions, and telling the user how to
          view a copy of this License.  (Exception: if the Program
          itself is interactive but does not normally print such an
          announcement, your work based on the Program is not required
          to print an announcement.)

     These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
     identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the
     Program, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate
     works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not
     apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate
     works.  But when you distribute the same sections as part of a
     whole which is a work based on the Program, the distribution of
     the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions
     for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each
     and every part regardless of who wrote it.

     Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or
     contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the
     intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of
     derivative or collective works based on the Program.

     In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the
     Program with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on
     a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the
     other work under the scope of this License.

  4. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
     under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms
     of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the
     following:

       a. Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
          source code, which must be distributed under the terms of
          Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for
          software interchange; or,

       b. Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
          years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
          cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
          machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
          distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
          medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

       c. Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
          to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
          allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
          received the program in object code or executable form with
          such an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)

     The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
     making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete
     source code means all the source code for all modules it contains,
     plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts
     used to control compilation and installation of the executable.
     However, as a special exception, the source code distributed need
     not include anything that is normally distributed (in either
     source or binary form) with the major components (compiler,
     kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable
     runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable.

     If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
     access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
     access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
     distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
     compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

  5. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
     except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
     otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
     void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this
     License.  However, parties who have received copies, or rights,
     from you under this License will not have their licenses
     terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

  6. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
     signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify
     or distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions
     are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.
     Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or any work
     based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this
     License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying,
     distributing or modifying the Program or works based on it.

  7. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
     Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
     original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program
     subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any
     further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights
     granted herein.  You are not responsible for enforcing compliance
     by third parties to this License.

  8. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
     infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent
     issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order,
     agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this
     License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this
     License.  If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously
     your obligations under this License and any other pertinent
     obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the
     Program at all.  For example, if a patent license would not permit
     royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who
     receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only
     way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain
     entirely from distribution of the Program.

     If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable
     under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is
     intended to apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply
     in other circumstances.

     It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
     patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of
     any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting
     the integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
     implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
     generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
     through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
     system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is
     willing to distribute software through any other system and a
     licensee cannot impose that choice.

     This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed
     to be a consequence of the rest of this License.

  9. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
     certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces,
     the original copyright holder who places the Program under this
     License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation
     excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only
     in or among countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this
     License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of
     this License.

 10. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
     versions of the General Public License from time to time.  Such
     new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but
     may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

     Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the
     Program specifies a version number of this License which applies
     to it and "any later version", you have the option of following
     the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later
     version published by the Free Software Foundation.  If the Program
     does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose
     any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

 11. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
     programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the
     author to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted
     by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software
     Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our decision
     will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of
     all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing
     and reuse of software generally.

                                NO WARRANTY
 12. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
     WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE
     LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT
     HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT
     WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT
     NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND
     FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE
     QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
     PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY
     SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

 13. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
     WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY
     MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE
     LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL,
     INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR
     INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF
     DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU
     OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY
     OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN
     ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

                      END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
=============================================

If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these
terms.

   To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

     ONE LINE TO GIVE THE PROGRAM'S NAME AND AN IDEA OF WHAT IT DOES.
     Copyright (C) 19YY  NAME OF AUTHOR

     This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
     modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License

   If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like
this when it starts in an interactive mode:

     Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) 19YY NAME OF AUTHOR
     Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details
     type `show w'.  This is free software, and you are welcome
     to redistribute it under certain conditions; type `show c'
     for details.

   The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the
appropriate parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the
commands you use may be called something other than `show w' and `show
c'; they could even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your
program.

   You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or
your school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program,
if necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:

     Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright
     interest in the program `Gnomovision'
     (which makes passes at compilers) written
     by James Hacker.

     SIGNATURE OF TY COON, 1 April 1989

   This General Public License does not permit incorporating your
program into proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine
library, you may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary
applications with the library.  If this is what you want to do, use the
GNU Library General Public License instead of this License.
