PIN Entry
---------

This is a collection of simple PIN or passphrase entry dialogs which
utilize the Assuan protocol as described by the aegypten project; see
http://www.gnupg.org/aegypten/ for details.

There are programs for different toolkits available.  For all GUIs it
is automatically detected which modules can be built, but it can also
be requested explicitely.

GUI		OPTION			 DEPENDENCIES
Curses		--enable-pinentry-curses Curses library, for example ncurses
GTK+ V1.2	--enable-pinentry-gtk	 Gimp Toolkit Library Version 1.2
			 		 eg. libgtk-1.2 and libglib-1.2
GTK+ V2.0	--enable-pinentry-gtk2	 Gimp Toolkit Library, Version 2.0
					 eg. libgtk-x11-2.0 and libglib-2.0
Qt		--enable-pinentry-qt	 Qt, eg. libqt or libqt-mt
Qt4		--enable-pinentry-qt4	 Qt4

The GTK+ and Qt pinentries can fall back to the curses mode.  The
option to enable this is --enable-fallback-curses, but this is also
detected automatically in the same way --enable-pinentry-curses is.
The fallback to curses also works if --disable-pinentry-curses is
specified.  So to disable linking to curses completely you have to
pass --disable-fallback-curses to the configure script as well.

Examples:
* To only build the GTK+ 1.2 pinentry with curses support:
./configure --enable-pinentry-gtk --enable-fallback-curses \
	--disable-pinentry-curses --disable-pinentry-qt

* To build the Qt pinentry, and the other pinentries if they are
  supported:
./configure --enable-pinentry-qt

* To build everything that is supported (complete auto-detection):
./configure

Some of the code is taken from Robert Bihlmeyer's Quintuple-Agent.
For security reasons, all internationalization has been removed.  The
client is expected to tell the PIN entry the text strings to be
displayed.


Curses Pinentry
---------------

The curses pinentry supports colors if the terminal does.  The colors
can be specified by the --colors=FG,BG,SO option, which sets the
foreground, background and standout colors respectively.  The standout
color is used for error messages.  Colors can be named by any of
"black", "red", "green", "yellow", "blue", "magenta", "cyan" and
"white".  The foreground and standout color can be prefixed by
"bright-", "bright", "bold-" and "bold", and any of these prefixes has
the same effect of making the color bolder or brighter.  Two special
color names are defined as well: "default" chooses the default color,
and "none" disables use of colors.  The name "none" is only meaningful
for the standout color and in this case a reversed effect is used for
error messages.  For the other colors, disabling colors means the same
as using the defaults.  The default colors are as follows:

	Foreground:	Terminal default
	Background:	Terminal default
	Standout:	Bright red

Note that color support is limited by the capabilities of the display
terminal.  Some color combinations can be very difficult to read, and
please know that colors are perceived differently by different people.
